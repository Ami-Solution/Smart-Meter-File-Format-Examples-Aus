Hi XXX,

Thank you for requesting for AusNet Services to supply you with your meter data. We have provided all the market validated meter data available in the period you requested.

There are several reasons why all the requested meter data may not be available. For example, you may have moved into your current premises during the period requested. It may also be that data is available in myHomeEnergy but not included in the attached file. This is because myHomeEnergy does not require market validated meter data.

You requested the following:

NMI	1111111111
Request from  	02 Dec 2013
Request to	01 Dec 2014
Source	30 min intervals
Format	NEM12
For this specific request, the following information has been provided:

Data supplied for period 02 Dec 2013 to 01 Dec 2014 (days inc. 364)

The meter data we have provided may not align in all respects to the data presented on your energy bill from your Retailer for the same period. If you have any concerns we suggest you discuss these with your electricity retailer.

If you requested your meter data in “My Power Planner” format, the attached file is ready to upload to the Victorian Government’s “My Power Planner on Switch On” website. Do not make any changes to the attached file as this may prevent it loading into “My Power Planner”.

Please note that “My Power Planner” requires at least twelve full complete months of interval energy data for any data to be uploaded. If twelve full complete months of suitable data is not available, your upload may fail. If this occurs, you can still obtain energy advice from the Victorian Government’s “Switch On” website using the “Flexible Pricing Profiler”, or from myHomeEnergy itself if you meter is providing indicative energy data.

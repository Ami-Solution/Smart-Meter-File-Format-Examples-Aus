## File naming
I've used the following naming convention: 
example-XX-STATE-COMPANYNAME-SOURCE-DATEOFEXPORT.fileExtension

* XX is a unique number
* STATE is the state of where the smart meter is
* COMPANYNAME is the name of the retailer or distributor who supplied the file e.g OriginEnergy
* SOURCE - WEB or EMAIL.  Web if you exported this from a web portal supplied by the retailer or distributor.  EMAIL if the retailer or distributor emailed it to you.
* DATEOFEXPORT - the date the file was exported eg 15112014


## Privacy
I recommend for the sake of privacy that you change the NMI and METER SERIAL to something arbitrary (but keeping the number of digits the same)

In many (all?) states of Australia, individuals, whose homes are equipped with smart meters, can download a copy of their historical electricity consumption data.

This data is typically provided by either the electricity distributor and/or the electricity retailer, via the web.

This data is very useful. For example as I've previously written about, [smart meter data is most helpful if you're considering buying solar panels](http://what.agreenidea.org/post/96779193636/9-tips-on-going-solar-australia).

## The problem
The problem is there is no common format in which the electricity companies supply this data. Across the nation there are likely dozens of different formats.
This makes it harder for developers than it ought to be, to build apps on top of this data. Apps like the Victoria Government's [My Power Planner](https://mpp.switchon.vic.gov.au/).

## The Solution
One solution is to solve this problem at the source, much like [the Green Button Initiative in the United States](http://what.agreenidea.org/post/28757165630/smartmetersopendata).

A simpler solution is to work with what we've got and build a tool which can take smart meter data in any of the myriad formats and convert it into one common format.  This repo is a minute step towards this goal. 

## The goal of this repo
The goal of this repo is to collate as many examples as possible of the different file formats used by Australian electricity utilities and distributors for exporting smart meter data.  Nothing more, nothing less.
